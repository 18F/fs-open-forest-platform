### Measuring your tree

At the Umatilla National Forest, we have limitations on the size of the tree you can cut. See below to help you measure and choose a tree that meets your permitâ€™s restrictions.

* Stump height: 10 inches or less above the ground
* Tree height: 14 feet maximum
* Take the whole tree: cutting the tree top off is prohibited.
* Remove snow around tree base so you can accurately measure the stump and tree height. 
* Cut off live limbs remaining on the stump.
