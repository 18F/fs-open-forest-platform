* Tools you might want to consider bringing with you include a handsaw to cut your tree; gloves to protect your hands; a tarp to sit on and/or to move your tree once it's cut; and rope or straps to secure your tree to your vehicle.
* Choose a tree from a dense forested area, which will give the remaining trees more space to grow.
* Be aware of where the tree will fall and ensure all people and vehicles are out of the path of the falling tree.
* Cut the leftover branches from the stump and scatter them.
